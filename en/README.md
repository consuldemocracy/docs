This is the opensource code repository of the eParticipation website CONSUL, originally developed for the Madrid City government eParticipation website.

## Current state

Development started on [2015 July 15th](https://github.com/consul/consul/commit/8db36308379accd44b5de4f680a54c41a0cc6fc6). Code was deployed to production on 2015 September 7th to [decide.madrid.es](https://decide.madrid.es). Since then new features are added often. You can take a look at the current features in [features]( http://www.decide.es/en/) or [docs](https://github.com/consul/consul/tree/master/doc) and future features in the [open issues list](https://github.com/consul/consul/issues). For current status on upcoming features go to [Roadmap](https://github.com/consul/consul/projects/6).
