# Contributing

We appreciate you want to help us by contributing to Consul Democracy. Here's a guide we made describing how to contribute changes to the project.

## Reporting an issue

If you have seen anything wrong in the platform performance or directly in the code, we encourage you to [open an issue in the Consul Democracy Github repository](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/issues/new).

Before doing it, **please take some time to check the [existing issues](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/issues) and make sure what you are about to report isn't already reported** by another person. In case someone else reported the same problem before, if you have more details about it you can write a comment in the issue page -a little more help can make a huge difference!

In order to write a new issue, take into account these few tips to make it easy to read and comprehend:

- Try to use a descriptive and to-the-point title.
- It's a good idea to include some sections -in case they're needed- such as: steps to reproduce the bug, expected behaviour/response, actual response or screenshots.
- Also it could be helpful to provide your operating system, browser version and installed plugins.

## Resolving an issue

[Issues in Consul Democracy](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/issues) labeled with `PRs-welcome` are well defined features ready to be implemented by whoever wants to do it. In the other hand, the `not-ready` label marks features or changes not well defined yet or subject to an internal decision, so we recommend not to try to resolve them until the admins come to a resolution.

We suggest to follow these steps to keep a good track of the changes you're about to make:

- First of all, add a comment to the issue to make everyone know you are going to work on it. If the issue has someone assigned it means that person is already solving it.
- Fork the project.
- Create a feature branch based on the `master` branch. To make it easier to identify, you can name it with the issue number followed by a concise and descriptive name (e.g. `123-fix_proposals_link`).
- Work in your branch committing there your changes.
- Make sure all tests are passing. In case you're extending or creating a new feature, consider adding its own specs.
- Once you've finished, send a **pull request** to the [Consul Democracy repository](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/) describing your solution to help us understand it. It's also important to tell what issue you're addressing, so specify it in the pull request description's first line (e.g. `Fixes #123`).
- Our core team will review your PR and suggest changes if necessary. If everything looks good, your changes will be merged :)
