# Communication

The preferred way to report any missing piece of information is [opening an issue in the project's Github repo](https://github.com/consul/docs/issues/new).

For more informal communication, chat with us at [Consul Democracy's gitter](https://gitter.im/consul/consul).

Before doing it, **please take some time to check the [existing issues](https://github.com/consul/consul/issues) and make sure what you are about to report isn't already reported** by another person. In case someone else reported the same problem before or a similar one, and you have more details about it, you can write a comment in the issue page... a little more help can make a huge difference!

In order to write a new issue, take into account these few tips to make it easy to read and comprehend:

- Try to use a descriptive and to-the-point title.
- It's a good idea to include some sections -in case they're needed- such as: steps to reproduce the bug, expected behaviour/response, actual response or screenshots.
- Also it could be helpful to provide your operating system, browser version and installed plugins.
